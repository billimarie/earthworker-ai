# Earthcare AI

Ask Anything. Grow Everything.

Introducing the world's first AI search that gives back to the Earth.

Earthcare AI is an AI search engine made to offset AI's carbon and water footprint&mdash;which accounts for **~3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions** ([Columbia.edu](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/06/09/ais-growing-carbon-footprint)) and **~0.5 L of water for every ~20 ChatGPT queries** ([Riverside.edu](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2023/04/28/ai-programs-consume-large-volumes-scarce-water)).

Your questions power real-world regeneration. Every time you search, we cultivate the earth.
