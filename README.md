# The AI Forest

Introducing the world's first artificially intelligent micro forest: backed by solar power, guided by neural networks, and built off of living data.

## Project Overview

The AI Forest is a real-life regeneration project based in the Mojave Desert of California. Combining agriculture science and environmental conservation with creative climate storytelling and digital participation, the AI Forest aims to offset global AI carbon and water footprints. (Across the world, AI accounts **~3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions** [[Columbia.edu](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/06/09/ais-growing-carbon-footprint)] and **~0.5 L of water for every ~20 ChatGPT queries** [[Riverside.edu](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2023/04/28/ai-programs-consume-large-volumes-scarce-water)].)

The AI Forest was inspired by For Every Star A Tree, the Starry Night Skoolie, Typewriter Poetry, and The Last Forest On Earth.

Regarding this repository, The AI Forest web app is a digital story and game where users can log in, collect Chrysalis Coins, dive into a fictional universe, and see (in real-time) the data collected by our real-life AI Forest.

In-Person, audiences can visit The AI Forest at our nonprofit ecofarm in the Mojave Desert. Guests can also book a reservation to stay overnight at The AI Forest glamping or camping centers.
